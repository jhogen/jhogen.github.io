The Mekong river and the Pearl river have a lot in common, they're both rivers in Asia, they flow through large urban delta's and much more. But they're also very different. For example the Mekong river has a long history of importance, while the Pearl river has only recently been as important and the amount of development in both urban delta's is very different, just to name a view.
<br> <br>
These differences are all the result of different factors: humans, nature, geography, etc. This means that an already large number of differences which are interesting on their own, are still subject to change. Because humans, nature and the earth itself will always keep changing.
<br> <br>
This page will be an in depth comparison of the Mekong river and the Pearl river and their respective delta's. It will be split up into a number of parapgraphs that each have their own subject. The text will be there to give a general impression, while the datavisualisations will show a more precise picture.

    <p class="parallax_description_bio"><img class="ComparisonCity" src="images/ComparisonCity.jpg" align=right width="40%" height="">Both the Pearl river- and the Mekong river delta are of great economic importance for their respective countries. 
<br>
<br>
The primary source of money in the Mekong river delta is agriculture. We're talking about rice terraces, fishing, etc. This is very different to the Pearl river delta where the primary source is centered more around services and technology. Which is possible due to the amount of funding and foreign investment in the region. 
	
		<br><br>
	The Pearl river delta is a lot more developed in it's economy than the Mekong river delta, which is what you'll see in the table below. 2 Trillion compared to 44 Billion.  This is almost a 50:1 ratio difference.

    <h4 class="parallax_history"><span style="color:#E6999D">HISTORY AND TRADE</span></h4>
    <p class="parallax_description_history">
The Pearl River Delta is, as explained in the previous paragraph, very important to China's domestic market and it's international trade. Which means it would be safe to assume that this area has always been inhabited and / or important, right?
<br>
<br>
Well, yes and no. The region has always been inhabited, but not in the proportions that we see now. The soil is very fertile, which has made it attractive for agriculture, which generally means the land will be more sparsely populated. But this does mean that the people that did inhabit the Pearl River Delta over 500 years ago, had a lot of produce to sell. This is where the history of trade in this area really begins. In 1557 the Portuguese, known at the time for their large empire, visited the people living in what they called: Macau. The Chinese and Portuguese got along very well and they established the first European trade-post in China. Their relationship was benificial for Portugal, but also for the Chinese. A lot of Chinese people from all over the area started migrating to the city, which led to the city rapidly growing in size and importance.
<br>
<br>
The growth of Hong Kong is a similar story. In 1699 the British East India Company first laid contact with the local Chinese people, which kickstarted the trade between these two countries. Though Hong Kong wouldn't overtake Macau in it's importance until the 19th century, it would remain relatively populated, with around 7000 people living there.
<br>
<br>
You should now know a little bit more about Macau and Hong Kong, the two exceptions in comparison to the total pattern of growth of the greater urban delta. What I mean by this, is that the rest of the surrounding delta was still very sparsely populated by farmers, atleast until the 1970's, when China launched it's reform programme. This lead to a flood of investment from every part of the country, turning it into an economic powerhouse. Which then garnered a lot of attention from foreign companies, who also started heavily investing in the area. Now, 50 years later, these investments aren't slowing down and the region is still growing rapidly, just as fast as half a century ago.
